Mean 3.0
--------

Calculates the mean of several entered numbers.

The numbers have to be entered as arguments when the program is invoked,
for example like this:

  ./mean 1.1 1.002 1.003 1.102

This will calculate the result

  1.051750

Attention: Use the dot (.) as the separator between integer digits and the
fraction digits, not the comma (,)

This invocation

  ./mean 1,1 1,002 1,003 1,102

will not work.

The result (mean of all numbers entered) will be displayed on the terminal.
